# Gladys MQTT

This module connect Gladys to a MQTT broker, in order to support [Owntrack](http://owntracks.org/), an open-source (and awesome) location tracker.

Need Gladys version >= 3.0.0.

## Documentation

To make this module work in Gladys, you need to :

- First, install the module
- Without rebooting, just set three global parameters in "Param" view in the dashboard : 
	- MQTT_URL => The URL of the MQTT broker, for example : "mqtt://xxxx.cloudmqtt.com:19692"
	- MQTT_USERNAME	=> The username to connect to the MQTT broker
	- MQTT_PASSWORD => The password of the MQTT user
- Reboot Gladys. In the logs you should see "Successfully connected to MQTT : YOUR_SERVER_URL" 

This should looks like this :

## Set up a MQTT broker

To set up your MQTT broker, you have two options :
- Install your own MQTT on your server or your Raspberry Pi
- Use a third-party MQTT Cloud 

To test this module in Gladys, I used [CloudMQTT](https://www.cloudmqtt.com/), the service is free up to 10 connections, so that's fine to test.

### CloudMQTT

If you want to use CloudMQTT, just create an account, confirm your email, then create an instance. 

This should looks like this :

You could now fill this infos in Gladys.

- MQTT_URL = mqtt://xxxx.cloudmqtt.com:PORT
- MQTT_USERNAME = User in info panel
- MQTT_USERNAME = Password in info panel


## Owntrack

To play with owntrack to save your location in Gladys, you need to install the [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mqttitude/id692424691?mt=8) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.owntracks.android) app.

In `Preferences`, go to `Connection`:

- `Mode` => "Private MQTT",
- `Host` => 
	- `Host` = xxxx.cloudmqtt.com
	- `Port` = SSL PORT (be careful, that's not the same port as before)
- `Identification` => 
	- `Username` => MQTTT username
	- `Password` => MQTT Password
	- `Device ID` => "whatever you want, name of your phone for example"
	- `Tracker ID` => Your UserID in Gladys (very important !), or the UserID you want to track

Then save, and you should see the message "Connected".
